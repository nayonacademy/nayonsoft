            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

           <p> At nayonSoft, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information when you use our Google Workspace app. </p>
            <p>This is the Global Data Privacy Policy, also referred to as the "Global Privacy Policy," which sets the minimum standards for the fair, transparent, and secure collection, use, retention, and disclosure of Personal Data. Our Policy meets, and in some cases exceeds, the requirements of relevant laws and regulations. It is in alignment with other specific policies implemented by each entity for the processing of Personal Data, such as cookies policy, employees' privacy policies, and information notices for customers. It acknowledges the differences in privacy and data protection laws and cultural approaches across various countries. In some geographic regions, this Policy may be supplemented by additional policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws and meet cultural norms.

              If there is a conflict between this Global Privacy Policy and applicable local privacy policies or laws or if any provisions of this Policy are inapplicable, the relevant local policy and law shall prevail. To assist you, we have provided definitions in section 2 of this Global Privacy Policy.
              </p>
            <h5>1. Scope </h5>
              <p>This Policy applies to all forms of Personal Data, regardless of its form, including electronic data, paper documents, and disks. It covers all types of processing, whether manual or automated, and is applicable to members, partners, employees, contractors, consultants, clients, consumers, suppliers, business contacts, and any third parties. The Policy also extends to Third Parties who are expected to adhere to the same standards of conduct as outlined in this Global Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h5>2. Definitions</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>2.1 A Third-Party refers to any individual or organization that receives Personal Data from nayonSoft or is granted access to or entrusted with Personal Data on behalf of nayonSoft. This may include suppliers, contractors, sub-contractors, and other service providers.</li>
            <li>2.2 The Data Subject refers to an identifiable natural person whose Personal Data is being processed by nayonSoft.</li>
            <li>2.3 Informed Consent means the voluntary, specific, and informed agreement of the Data Subject to the processing of their Personal Data when required.</li>
            <li>2.4 Personal Data means any information that can directly or indirectly identify a natural person, such as an identification number or one or more factors specific to their physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity. Data is considered Personal Data if it can be linked to a natural person, even if the holder of that information cannot make that connection.</li>
            <li>2.5 Sensitive Data (or Special Category of Data) includes data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health, or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.</li>
            <li>2.6 Personal Data relating to criminal convictions and offences is a subset of Personal Data that, due to their sensitive nature, have been classified by law or applicable policy as deserving additional privacy and security protections.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5>3. How do we ensure the lawfulness, fairness and transparency of your Personal Data?</h5>
          <p> Personal Data is processed on the basis of legal grounds with the informed knowledge of the Data Subjects.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>3.1 The usage of Personal Data will be based only on a legal basis:
              <p>When it is necessary for the performance of a contract, such as with employees, contractors, clients, and suppliers. Application Data, in particular, will only be used for providing online services under the contract.</p>
              <p>When it is required to comply with a legal obligation, such as our obligations as an employer.</p> 
              <p>When there is a legitimate business need or reason to use Personal Data as part of our business activities. This includes processing to understand our clients better and offer them promotional offers, except for Application Data.</p> 
              <p>When we have obtained the Informed Consent of the Data Subject, specifically required by law or applicable policy, and where none of the other legal bases apply, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p>  
            </li>
            <li>3.2 We understand the importance of evaluating the privacy risks associated with collecting, using, retaining, or disclosing Personal Data, such as in a new system or project.</li>
            <li>3.3 nayonSoft will process Personal Data only in the manner described in its specific privacy notices or policies and in accordance with any Informed Consent obtained from the Data Subject.</li>
            <li>3.4 We will not engage in profiling activities based on automated decision making, except when legally required under applicable law or contract performance, or when the Data Subject has provided consent. In such cases, we will implement appropriate safeguards to protect the Data Subject's rights.</li>
            <li>3.5 We utilize cookie technologies on our websites to assess and enhance website functionality. We may also use cookies for advertising or analytics purposes, subject to your consent and preferences through our cookie settings tool. Please refer to our online Cookie Policy for further information on how nayonSoft uses cookies.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>4. How do we process Personal Data for specific and legitimate purpose?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>4.1 Personal Data processing is carried out solely for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes. The collection and processing of Personal Data adheres to the Personal Data minimization principle and ensures the accuracy of the processed Personal Data.</li>
            <li>4.2 Personal Data is not processed further in a manner that is incompatible with the specified purposes.</li>
            <li>4.3 The collected Personal Data are relevant, adequate, and not excessive in relation to the Processing and eventual use, such as insights, marketing, or promotions. This means that only necessary and relevant Personal Data are collected and processed.</li>
            <li>4.4 When collecting Sensitive Data or Personal Data relating to criminal convictions and offences, proportionality is fundamental. Sensitive Data or Personal Data relating to criminal convictions and offences are not collected unless required by applicable law or with the Data Subject's prior express consent, as allowed by applicable law.</li>
            <li>4.5 Reasonable measures are taken to ensure that Personal Data is maintained in an accurately updated form throughout the Personal Data Processing, including collection, transfer, storage, and retrieval.</li>
            <li>4.6 Data Subjects are encouraged to exercise their rights, notably of access and rectification, to assist in maintaining accurate and up-to-date Personal Data.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5>5. What Security and confidentiality measures are implemented?</h5>
          <p>Since employees, contractors, customers, suppliers, consumers and business partners put their trust in nayonSoft when they provide us with their Personal Data, nayonSoft ensures the security and confidentiality of the Personal Data it processes.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>5.1 Personal Data collected, used, retained, and disclosed to support nayonSoft's business activities are protected by adhering to relevant policies, standards, and processes.</li>
            <li>5.2 Industry-standard measures are in place to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access to Personal Data or any other unlawful or unauthorized forms of Processing.</li>
            <li>5.3 If Processing is to be carried out on behalf of nayonSoft, it will select service providers who can implement appropriate measures to meet applicable data protection laws and ensure the protection of Data Subject rights.</li>
            <li>5.4 nayonSoft will take necessary measures based on Privacy by design and Privacy by default to implement safeguards when Processing Personal Data. This means implementing technical and organizational measures at the earliest stages of Processing to safeguard privacy and data protection principles (‘Privacy by design’). nayonSoft will ensure that Personal Data is processed with privacy protection by default (e.g., only processing necessary data, short storage period, limited accessibility) to prevent Personal Data from being accessible to an indefinite number of people (‘Privacy by default’).</li>
            <li>5.5 When Personal Data Processing is likely to result in a high risk to Data Subject rights and freedoms, a privacy impact assessment or “Personal Data impact assessment” will be conducted before implementation.</li>
            <li>5.6 nayonSoft will investigate all claims related to any breach to this Global Privacy Policy or applicable data protection laws, potential or actual, that are brought to its attention or that it becomes aware of and will take all reasonable measures to limit their impact, regardless of size.</li>
            <li>5.7 For more information on IT security measures, please refer to nayonSoft's Information Security Policy.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>6. For how long do we keep your Personal Data?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>6.1 Principle of data retention: nayonSoft requires that any person or entity handling Personal Data will only retain it for as long as necessary for the purpose for which it has been collected and processed. This includes supporting nayonSoft's business activities, complying with legal or regulatory requirements, and fulfilling applicable statute of limitation requirements. In certain cases, such as defending against legal or contractual actions, the Personal Data may be retained until the end of the corresponding statute of limitation or in accordance with any applicable litigation hold policies.</li>
            <li>6.2 Data retention and destruction: Personal Data will be retained and destroyed in accordance with applicable law and nayonSoft's Data Retention Policy.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>7. What are your rights as a Data Subject?</h5>
          <p>We welcome queries or requests from Data Subjects concerning their Personal Data. As required by law, we provide Data Subjects with the ability to access, correct, restrict, and erase their Personal Data, in accordance with applicable laws. We also enable them to object to the processing of their Personal Data and to exercise their right to data portability.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>7.1 Access right: Data Subjects have the right to access their Personal Data and obtain information on the purposes of the Processing, categories of Personal Data processed, categories of recipients, data retention term, rights to rectify, delete or restrict the Personal Data accessed if applicable, as required by law.</li>
            <li>7.2 Right to portability: Data Subjects may request a copy of their Personal Data that we hold in our records in a format compatible and structured to allow the exercise of the right to data portability to the extent it is relevant under applicable law.</li>
            <li>7.3 Right to rectification: Data Subjects can request that we correct, amend, or erase any Personal Data which is incomplete, out of date, or inaccurate.</li>
            <li>7.4 Right to erasure: Data Subjects can request the deletion of their Personal Data if (i) such Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purpose of the data processing, (ii) the Data Subject has withdrawn their consent on the Processing based exclusively on such consent, (iii) the Data Subject objected to the Processing, (iv) the Personal Data Processing is unlawful, or (v) the Personal Data must be erased to comply with a legal obligation applicable to nayonSoft. nayonSoft will take reasonable steps to inform other entities of nayonSoft of such erasure.</li>
            <li>7.5 Right to restriction: Data Subjects can request the restriction of their Personal Data in the event the accuracy of the Personal Data is contested to allow nayonSoft to check such accuracy, if the Data Subject wishes to restrict the Personal Data rather than deleting it despite the fact that the Processing is unlawful, if the Data Subject wishes nayonSoft to keep the Personal Data because they need it for their defense in the context of legal claims, or if the Data Subject has objected to the Processing but nayonSoft conducts verification to check whether it has legitimate grounds for such Processing which may override the Data Subject's own rights.</li>
            <li>7.6 Right to withdraw consent: Data Subjects have the right to withdraw their consent at any moment when the Personal Data Processing is based on their consent, without affecting the lawfulness of Processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
            <li>7.7 Right to object: Data Subjects can indicate their objection to the Processing of their Personal Data at any time when used for marketing purposes or profiling to send targeted advertising or to object to the sharing of their Personal Data with third parties or within nayonSoft, or when the Processing is based on nayonSoft's legitimate interest, unless nayonSoft demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the Processing which override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the Data Subject or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
            <li>7.8 Digital legacy: Data Subjects have the right to define (general or specific) directives regarding the usage of their Personal Data after their death.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Data Subjects also have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent Personal Data supervisory authority.</p>

          <h5>8. When and how do we disclose your Personal Data?</h5>
          <p>Personal Data is only disclosed outside nayonSoft where there is an overarching legal justification to do this.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>8.1 Disclosure is made on a strictly limited 'need to know' basis where there is clear justification for transferring Personal Data - either because the Data Subject has consented to the transfer or because disclosure is required to perform or reach an agreement, or for a legitimate purpose that does not infringe the Data Subject's fundamental rights, including the right to privacy (e.g. sharing in the context of a merger and acquisition operation). In each case the Data Subject will be aware that the disclosure is likely to take place. Assurances will also be sought from the recipients that they will only use the Personal Data for legitimate / authorized purposes and keep it secure.</li>
            <li>8.2 If necessary and relevant, Personal data can be disclosed: nayonSoft may also disclose Personal Data to the extent required by law and/or competent authorities.</li>
            <li>8.3 If a particular disclosure is required to meet a legal obligation (for example to a government agency or police force / security service) or in connection with legal proceedings, generally the Personal Data may be provided as long as the disclosure is limited to that which is legally required and, if permitted by law, the Data Subject has been made aware of the situation (i.e. the Data Subject was told of the possibility of such an event in an Informed Consent or is notified at the time of the request for disclosure).</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>9. How do we handle complaints?</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>9.1 nayonSoft is committed to resolving the legitimate privacy issues of its staff, clients and other contacts.

              Data Subjects are also informed that they may file a complaint with a supervisory authority.</li>
            <li>9.3 If a Data Subject covered by this Global Privacy Policy files a complaint about the Processing of his/her or someone else’s Personal Data, and the complaint is not satisfactorily resolved, nayonSoft will cooperate with the appropriate data protection Supervisory Authorities and comply with the advice of such authorities to resolve any outstanding complaints. In the event that nayonSoft Privacy Contact or the data protection Supervisory Authorities determine that nayonSoft or one or more of its staff failed to comply with this Global Privacy Policy or the data protection laws, upon recommendation of the authorities or nayonSoft Privacy Contact, nayonSoft will take appropriate steps to address any adverse effects and to promote future compliance.</li>
          </ul>
