If You are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of a company, You represent that You have the authority to bind that company to these Terms. If You have obtained a license to use the Service through an authorized nayonSoft reseller, You are also bound to comply with the terms of any agreement between You and the reseller. If any inconsistency exists between these Terms and any reseller agreements, these Terms shall prevail. If You register for the Service's free tier, these Terms will apply to your use and access of the Service under that free tier.</p>
            
            <h5>Description of Service</h5>
             <p>ChatGPT is a Google Docs™, Sheet™ and Slider™ add-on for Google Workspace which interoperates with OpenAI API and which displays the output relating to any such interoperation in a Google sheet or a Google document.</p>
             <p> OpenAI (hereinafter, “OpenAI”) is a solution provided by OpenAI, L.L.C. and notably subject to Terms of Use (available at https://openai.com/terms/), Service Terms (available at</p>
              https://openai.com/api/policies/service-terms/), Sharing & Publication Policy (available at
              https://openai.com/api/policies/sharing-publication/) and Usage Policies (available at
              https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-policies). All the aforementioned OpenAI’s terms applicable to OpenAI are referred below as “OpenAI Terms”. For the avoidance of doubt, OpenAI is deemed to be a Third Party Offering, as such term is deﬁned below.<p>
              The Service is provided subject to these Terms and solely for Your internal business purposes. You may connect to the Service using any Internet browser supported by the Service.</p>
              <p>To use the Service, you need a Google account to access Google Docs™, Sheet™ and Slider™ on which the Service is installed. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the necessary equipment and Internet access to use the Service, and to install the Service appropriately. You are responsible for all associated fees.</p>
              <p>You are also responsible for keeping your password confidential and securing your Google account against unauthorized access. Do not share your password with anyone other than authorized Users. If you suspect that your password has been lost, stolen, or disclosed to an unauthorized third party, or if there is any unauthorized use of your password or Google account, you must notify nayonSoft immediately. You are solely responsible for any activities that occur through the use of your Google account or the Google accounts of any authorized Users.</p>

            <h5>Modifications</h5>  
             <p>Regarding these Terms, nayonSoft reserves the right to modify and update them with notice provided through email or publication on the Google Workspace marketplace. If any changes substantially affect your rights in connection with your use of the Service, you may terminate your use of the Service. By continuing to use the Service after any modifications, you agree to the updated Terms. You can access the current version of the Terms at any time.</p>
             <p>Concerning the Service, nayonSoft may make changes and modifications to it, including updates, upgrades, additions, and new features, which will also be subject to these Terms. Material changes or modifications will be notified to you. Additional terms and conditions may be required for certain features or tools.</p>
             <p>If you issue a purchase order or any payment instrument for Service fees to nayonSoft, any additional terms and conditions in the purchase order that conflict with or add to these Terms will be rejected by nayonSoft and replaced with the terms and conditions outlined in these Terms.</p>
            
            <h5>Use of the Service</h5>
