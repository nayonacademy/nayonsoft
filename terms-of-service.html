            <h5>Limitation of Liability</h5>
            <p>nayonSoft provides the Service and any Third Party Offering on an "as is" basis, and is not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of business profits, business interruption, computer failure, or loss of business information, arising from or caused by your use of or inability to use the Service or any Third Party Offering. Even if nayonSoft has been advised of the possibility of such damages, your sole and exclusive remedy for any dispute with nayonSoft related to the Service or any Third Party Offering shall be termination of the Service. Furthermore, nayonSoft's entire liability to you for any Service, whether direct or indirect, is limited to the fees paid by you for such Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to such liability.</p>
            <p>It is understood and agreed that nayonSoft set fees and entered into these Terms with you based on the limitations of liability set forth herein, which allocate risk between the parties and form the basis of the agreement between the parties. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the limitations or exclusions in this section may not apply to you. In such an event, liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law in that jurisdiction.</p>
            <h5>Other Terms</h5>
            <p>If either party is unable to perform its obligations under these Terms due to any cause beyond its control, such as acts of God, acts of government, fire, or flood, then that party will not be held liable to the other party or any third party for such failure or delay. However, once such events have ceased, the affected party must promptly perform or complete its obligations under these Terms.</p>
            <p>During the term of these Terms, if you choose to become a paying customer of the Service, nayonSoft may identify you as a nayonSoft customer by stating it orally or including your name, trademarks, trade names, service marks, or logos in a list of nayonSoft customers, whether online or offline. Additionally, nayonSoft may generally describe the products or services it provides to you in its promotional materials, presentations, and proposals to other current and prospective customers. You have the right to revoke nayonSoft’s use of your trademarks, trade names, service marks, or logos by providing written notice to nayonSoft and allowing a reasonable period for them to stop using them.</p>
